Create a drop-wizard service with the following:

A User rest Resource that allows clients to create, read, update, delete a user or list all users. 

You can use JDBI3 with a database of your choice but it's also fine to just use a Map<String, User> in memory to keep track of users by their ids. 

Make use of logging and metrics in the resource. 

Write unit tests for the service. 

Use the jacoco-maven-plugin for unit test coverage. Or whatever, you can also use gradle if you prefer that to maven.

See: https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.5/docs/getting-started.html

The user JSON can just be id, first name, last name, zip code, and email address. Extra points if the User class is immutable. 


Expected time for exercise: 4 hours
