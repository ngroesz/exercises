Find the number of steps in a path moving left, right, up, down
1 is a valid node but 0 is ... hot-lava or something
9 is the target
we always start at [0][0] (upper left-hand corner)
So, given a graph like:
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 9 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0

10 is the answer as that is the length of the shortest (and only) path
